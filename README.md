Commodity Risk Monitor

Option prices across strike prices provide relevant information about market expectations on the price distribution of the underlying asset. By using a slight variation of Figlewsky's method, which is described in detail in 'Estimating of the Implied Risk Neutral Density for the U.S. Market Portfolio', we were able to extract these distributions and quantify the probabilities of different price variations.
